            <h3>Various User Interface (UI) designs for Timetabling Application</h3>
			<p>The following images showcase the interface design ideas that I created for an assignment during my third year of university. I was asked to brainstorm and prototype an idea for an app, which would help a target audience with various struggles. For my idea, I decided to go with prototyping a timetabling application for university students who struggle with time management skills.</p>
			<p>To begin the UI design process, I drew a few sketches of my idea for the interface so that it accommodates all the features for the app. Below are the sketches for the app's UI design.</p>

			<p>After drawing some sketches, I decided to use a prototyping software called Axure to turn these sketches into a UI design.</p>
			<p>For the colour scheme, I chose blue as the default colour as blue corresponds to <b>calmness</b>, and I wish for users to feel relaxed entering the app. I also added a dark mode option for those who wish for the app to be "easy on the eyes".</p>
