			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>In 2019, I enrolled into Crosskeys college, located in Newport Gwent, for a total of 2 years. Here, I studied three subjects: <b>Computer Science, Maths, and French</b>. I chose Computer Science and Maths, as programming was (and still is) my passion, and I chose French, as many of my lecturers told me that my French pronounciation is very good, and I wanted to learn a language during my study.</p>
			<p>In 2021, I then enrolled into Cardiff University, as I was presented a conditional offer and met their requirements. I studied Computer Science in this university for a total of 3 years.</p>
