            <h3>A written tutorial that talks about getting started with creating and programming a discord bot in Python (2024)</h3>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			I see you've taken interest in building a discord bot in Python, or perhaps you’re an expert 
			getting yourself back into building bot. Well, no matter your level, you're in the right place! 
			In this article, I'll walk you through the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Creating the Discord bot from the discord developer portal
				<li>An overview on bot tokens, and why you should not share them with anyone
				<li>An overview of Replit, my choice when it comes to programming bots
				<li>Programming your first discord bot
				<li>Testing your Python discord bot
				<li>Conclusion – What’s next?
			</ul>
			It may sound like a lot to cover, but once you've read about them all, and gone to practise 
			these points, it'll become second nature to you. Let's get started!

			<h3>Creating a Bot in the Discord Developer Portal</h3>
			<img src="pictures/dev_portal.png" width="900" height="300">
			<p>Okay, let me start by talking about the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord developer portal</a>, which sounds quite self explanatory. It's where developers go to create their own, well, applications. Its main  purpose is for Discord bots, but there’s other features you can use too.
			<p>For example, on the side bar, there’s an option called “Server Insights”. This allows you to choose a server you own, or are an admin for, and can see information about the server in general, as well as growth, engagement from users and the members within the community.
			To access the page shown on the image above, you'll need to sign into your account.
			<p>On the top right of the screen, next to your Discord profile picture, you can see a button labelled "New Application". Let’s go ahead and click it.
		
			<img src="pictures/create_bot.png" width="500" height="300">
			<p>We’re greeted with a small window asking for the name. You can call it anything you want, for this, I’ll just call mine “My Python Bot”. 
			<p>I know, <i>very</i> creative. 
			<p>We agree with the terms of service, and create our bot.</p>

			<img src="pictures/bot_general_info.png" width="800" height="300">
			<p>Jeez! That’s a lot of options! And the interface looks super organised too. I love it. 
			<p>Okay, we created our bot!
			<p>Keep in mind that the name stated here is <b>not</b> the same as the bot’s name, and you can change the bot’s name and description in the “Bot” option on the side bar. 
			
			<p>Let’s move on, shall we?

			<h3>An Overview on Bot Tokens</h3>
 
			<p>Let’s move on to discussing bot tokens. In short, they’re basically super long strings that are uniquely assigned to your Discord bot when it’s created. Think of it as your bot’s ID. These will be used to connect our bot to another website, which we’ll use to program our bot later 
			on. 
			<p>It’s important to note that you do not share your unique bot token with anyone, as anyone with the token can completely take over your bot, so it’s best to keep it to yourself. Which is  what I’m going to do. I don’t want you all stealing my tutorial bot please. 
			Thank you. 


			<p>In the image above, you may notice the “Reset Token” button right next to the profile 
			picture. If you go ahead and click to reset your bot’s token, it will first give you a popup 
			message, basically confirming your choice, and then this screen comes up. Your bot’s token 
			will be where the yellow line is, and they’ll be a copy button to retrieve it. 
				
			<p>Also, the profile picture will be a completely random colour, but it seems I was lucky this 
			time and got my favourite colour: yellow! Awesome! I mean, I need to stay professional. 

			<p>Of course, you can change your bot’s profile picture anytime. 
			<p>We can now move on to talking about the website: Replit! 
				
			<h3>An Overview of Replit</h3>
				
			<p>Click <a href="https://replit.com/~">here</a> to be taken to Replit.</p>
			In the above image is Replit’s homepage. It’s used for basically anything coding related: 
			deployment, selling your application, an AI coding bot, you name it. Of course, there is 
			indeed a paid plan too, where you can see the button “Join Replit Core”, bottom left. For this 
			tutorial, we won’t need the paid version, as we’re only using the website to program our 
			Discord bot. 
			
			<p>Let’s create ourselves a new “Repl”. 
			
			<p>We choose Python, name it whatever we want, and go ahead and create it. Once done, we 
			are greeted with the following screen (well, after a bit of loading)
