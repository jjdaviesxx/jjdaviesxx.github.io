			<h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>[IMAGE GOES HERE]</p>
            <p>I see you've taken interest in building a discord bot in Python. Well, you're in the right place! In this article, I'll walk you through the following:</p>
			<li>Creating the Discord bot from the discord developer portal</li>
			<li>An overview on bot tokens, and why you should <b>not</b> share them with anyone</li>
			<li>An overview of Replit, my choice when it comes to programming bots</li>
			<li>Programming your first discord bot</li>
			<p>It may sound like a lot to cover, but once you've read about them all, and gone to practise these points, it'll become second nature to you. Let's get started!</p>

			<p>Okay, let me start by talking about the discord developer portal, which sounds somewhat self-explanatory. It's where developers go to create their own, well, applications, and not just discord bots.</p>
			<p>To access the page shown on the image above, you'll need to sign into your account.</p>
			<p>On the top right of the screen, next to your Discord profile picture, you can see a button labelled "New Application"</p>
